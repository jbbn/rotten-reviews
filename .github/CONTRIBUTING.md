# Contribution guide

Thank your for your interest in contributing to `rotten-reviews`. Not much to say, here are the things that you must know when contributing to this repository:

## 1. Submit PRs to `develop` branch

`master` branch is for stable releases and also tagged accordingly. Any PRs from `master` branches will be moved to `develop` and will also cause many conflicts. If you have a better suggestion regarding this standard, do submit an issue and propose a better structure.

## 2. Anykind of contributions are allowed, even minor typos

Typos are inevitable, whether it's a typo on the source code or on the readmes, any typo corrections are allowed. Just make sure it's really a reasonable typo correction and [not this ridiculous pull request](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/584/files).

## 3. Be an awesome open sourcerer
